    <01> description : My husband is over-possessive and controlling. Please help me.

    <02> patient : Hello doctor, I am newly married. My husband is 26 years old and I am six months younger to him. My family members say that my husband is over-possessive and controlling. How can I know if my husband is over-possessive and controlling?

    <03> doctor : "Hi. Most of the persons who are over-possessive of their partner show certain kinds of behavior that is uncommon in the general population. They feel less secure and this sense of insecurity is the driving force for the over-possessive nature. Someone who is insecure may doubt their partner's dedication and may, therefore, try to control them. In short, they feel vulnerable and will do anything to make sure they are not hurt. The sense of insecurity can stem from a number of situations including parents leaving a child, a past romantic partner who was unfaithful and many more. To control the possessiveness: Consult a psychiatrist online in case of further assistance in overcoming this situation -->"
