<01> description : Why do I face difficulty in losing weight?

<02> patient : Hi doctor, I am a 35 year old woman. My height is 5'3"" and weight is 147lbs. I do not have a child yet, but will be trying to conceive soon. I am a vegan and eat healthy. I workout five days a week and sometimes will go for a 5 km runs around two to three times a week as well. I went off my birth control pill about three months ago and have not had a period since. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 15, but after going vegan two years ago, doctor said it definitely helped with symptoms. I have been eating right and working out for the last three months, and my weight has not budged. In fact, it seems I have gained numbers on the scale. Three months ago, I was 139 lbs. Is there anything in my report that could be the reason for not being able to lose weight or abdominal fat? Is there anything in the infertility test portion that could indicate the issues in trying to conceive? I would like to get a professional advice on my blood work results. I am mainly looking to find out if anything on here can indicate infertility or difficulty in losing weight. Please help.
