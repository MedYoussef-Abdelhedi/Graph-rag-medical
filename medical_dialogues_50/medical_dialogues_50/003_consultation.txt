<01> description : I have started to get lots of acne on my face, particularly on my forehead. Please help me.

<02> patient : Hi doctor! I used to have clear skin but since I moved to a new place, I started to have lots of acne on my face particularly on my forehead. I thought it would disappear once I went back home, but it only got worse. I did some research and assumed that it was caused by drinking too much cow's milk, but it has been since since I stopped and they would still not go away. I also noticed that I get deep acne whenever I'm nearing my period, along with the usual small red bumps. I bought an acne soap and have been using it for a month now but I'm not sure if it works. I hope you can help me because it has been affecting my mental state lately :((((

<03> doctor : Hi there Acne has multifactorial etiology. Only acne soap does not improve if ypu have grade 2 or more grade acne. You need to have oral and topical medications. This before writing medicines i need to confirm your grade of acne. For mild grade topical clindamycin or retenoic acud derivative would suffice whereas for higher grade acne you need oral medicines aluke doxycycline azithromycin or isotretinoin.
