<01> description : I masturbate only by rubbing the tip of the penis. Is it a wrong way?

<02> patient : Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing? I do notÂ get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract. Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help.

<03> doctor : Hi. For further doubts consult a sexologist online -->
