<01> description : I had a surgery which ended up with some failures. What can I do to fix it?

<02> patient : Hello doctor,I had an emergency surgery six months ago punched through a window right arm cut both arteries cut radial nerve with ulnar damage and cut bicep tendon nerves back now almost full thumbs up the only issue is bicep. My question is there something I can do to fix it like lengthening surgery, or am I stuck? I am a boxer supposed to go Olympics this year. My surgeon focused on the nerve and did not care help. PS pronator is still little and has not fully recovered.

<03> doctor : "Hello. If you are saying it is already six months since the surgery and if you are doing regular physiotherapy, still has not gained much of the actions, then it is not worth waiting anymore. There are many muscle transfer surgeries which can give you the desired movements and help you in day today activities. But you have to remember that post such operations you will require time to train the brain and get the full use of such movements. That will take time. Do not want to demotivate you, but tremendous training and hard work might be required to reach the pre trauma stage of your boxing."
