<01> description : Please enlighten me on non-invasive procedures to detect prostate cancer.

<02> patient : Hello doctor, I am a 79 year old male. Excellent health, take no medications with the exception of an occasional Viagra. In a recent DRE, my urologist discovered two small nodules on my prostate. A PSA at the time was 6.3. Over the years, I have ranged in 2's and 3's. He suggested a biopsy of the prostate. I have read many negative things about this process. I have also read about nonevasive procedures to detect for cancer.

<03> doctor : "Hi. I have gone through your query. I concur with your urologist in the need for a biopsy. Any PSA (prostate-specific antigen) more than 4 or abnormal findings on DRE (digital rectal examination) needs evaluation to rule out prostate cancer. None of the non-invasive techniques are sufficiently accurate as a biopsy at present. The closest is an MRI which, if positive, needs to be confirmed by a biopsy, and if negative does not exactly rule out a malignancy, you will need a biopsy nevertheless. Many blood tests are available but those are only if the DRE is normal and will not be applicable in your situation. Hope this was helpful, feel free to revert back with any other questions.
