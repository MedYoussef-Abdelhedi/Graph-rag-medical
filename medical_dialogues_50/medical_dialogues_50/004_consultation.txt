<01> description : Why do I have uncomfortable feeling between the middle of my spine and left shoulder blade?

<02> patient : Hello doctor,I am having an uncomfortable feeling in between the middle of my spine and left shoulder blade. It seems to get stiff, and my bones pop a lot around there, and it is very uncomfortable to sit in specific ways feels like my bones shift, well the other night it seemed as if my shoulder would pop out of place causing more stiffness after a while of dealing with it. I ended up feeling a popping sensation, where the stiffness was an instant relief. It was so shocking it put my anxiety through the roof. I thought I was going to die because my whole body was shaking and tingling. What am I dealing with? Right now I have no pain or tender near that area still relief but curious on what happened and why I got this shock and that popping feeling so loud it scared me half to death.

<03> doctor : "Hello. The popping and discomfort what you felt is either because of improper scapulothoracic mobility or may be due to facet joint irritation in the neck with intervertebral hypermobility. Which could have caused due to stiffness in the chest muscles, shoulder stiffness, etc.  I would recommend you to do a lot of icing in the chest and back muscles. Maintain your neck and upper back posture by doing some back retraction work. Gently stretch your neck and chest. Gently massage your chest and shoulders to relieve tension in the muscles. I hope this is helpful for now. Kindly revert in case you need any help in this regard."
