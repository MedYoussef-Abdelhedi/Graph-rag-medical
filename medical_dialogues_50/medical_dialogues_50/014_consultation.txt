And antibiotic like augmentin are notorious to cause this. This occur secondary to effect of augmentin on decreasing the amount of lactobacillus microorganism which are normally present in the human gut and help digest the food. You should take yougurt, Kefir (fermented yougurt), Kefir. and there are certain diets with probiotic activity you can start taking it. Plus take Tab Ecotec twice daily for 4 weeks, and Tab Levosulpiride 75 mg once daily half hour before meals.for 2 weeks. You can continue with acinil O syp. while rest of your current medication can be stopped. I hope this will correct your microbiota and will bring the same healthiness as before. good day Antibiotic induced dysbiosis Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth Antibiotic induced dysbiosis Let me know in one week time how you respond to above regimen, if persistent of symptoms I would consider testing and giving some safe antibiotic therapy for 2 weeks."
