<01> description : What is the reason for continuous eye allergy and irritation?

<02> patient : Hi doctor, I haveÂ eye allergy for the past 1.7 years. I have consulted many doctors. I am using steroid eye drops too, but my eye allergy is still present. My eye irritates when it contact with blowing air, perfumes, air conditioner, strong odors, when I get cold and sometimes suddenly without any exposure. Occasionally, it causes pain in the eyes and head. I do not know what caused this. What is the permanent solution for this? Is there any other alternate remedy for this? When I take Cetirizine my irritation subsides in 30 minutes. Please help.

<03> doctor : Hi. For further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->
