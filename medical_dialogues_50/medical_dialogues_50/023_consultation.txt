<01> description : Why are my hands and feet cold and sweaty always?

<02> patient : Hello doctor, I am a 30 year old male, who weighs 200 lbs and 6 feet tall.Â I have been looking for my symptoms after watching a TV show. I know some things are not right with me, and I have been curious to find the cause. It could be one or more problems. Here is what is going on. I have cold hand and feet, sweaty hands and feet, many bumps in the arms, mainly right arm, sand paper hair since a young age, and my feet getÂ numb and eventually very painful when walking. I have severe vitamin D deficiency, and my eyelids are always half closed. I have low metabolism, and I experience a lot of teeth problems. I might have osteoporosis. What is causing all this? Is it tumors or parasites or a neurological problem?

<03> doctor : "Hello. Cold and sweaty hands and feet can happen in heart failure, anxiety, hyperthyroidism and shock. Numb feet, which are painful while walking can be due to neuropathy, nerve root compression at lumbosacral spine, or arterial occlusion in legs. The half closed eyelids can be ptosis, or something else. I suggest you get the following tests done: Since when you are having these problems? Do you have any impending doom, palpitation, breathlessness? I suggest you meet a neurologist in-person for proper clinical examination and better judgment.
