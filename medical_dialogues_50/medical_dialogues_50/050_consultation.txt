<01> description : Is it safe to take Clenbuterol being overweight and asthmatic?

<02> patient : Hi doctor, I am 33 years old. My height is 176 cm and I weigh 77 kg.Â I started hitting gym a month back. I am into 1 hour daily workout, which include both aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Â As per the BMI report, IÂ was informed to keep my weight under 67-72 kg. Recently my gym trainer informed me about the pill Clenbuterol and it is safe to go for it. I went through a few websites and came to know it is more effective in burning fat, muscle build up and also used for treating asthma patients. My medical background is, I am an asthma patient. My recent medical checkup indicated that I have BP which is marginally little higher than regular and doctors indicated that it is not that much to be concerned about. I came to know, Clenbuterol is a steroid which has lots of other side effects like muscle cramp, dizziness, hand shaking, heart problems and effect on aorta. It has short and long-term effects too. It is completely banned in few countries and not available through prescription as well. Can you please inform me whether I have to go for it? Also, I want to reduce my weight without any side effects. As I am working as a software engineer, there might be a possibility that I will be traveling across countries and need to go for blood and urine tests for visa approval. I would like to know whether it will cause any problem in these cases as it is an illegal drug. Please let me know if any further details required from my side. Thank you in advance.
