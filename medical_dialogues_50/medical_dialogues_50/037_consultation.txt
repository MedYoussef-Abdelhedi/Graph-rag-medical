<01> description : When should I stop Clexane and Ecosprin should before delivery?

<02> patient : Hello doctor, Presently I am on my 34 th weeks of pregnancy. LMP was before eight months. I had an IUD of more than 37 weeks before two years. Present medications are Clexane 20, and Ecosprin 75 daily. As per my doctor's planning, I should go for C-section between 36 to 37 weeks. Now when I should stop my Claxene and Ecospirin? This medication is given by my gynecologist after analyzing my boh panel report which states lupus anticoagulant by DRVTT is 45.50. No lupus-like anticoagulant present, APTT is 31.30 and PTT-LA is 98.80. Kindly advice.

<03> doctor : "Hello.  I feel that it would be the best if you do not stop these medicines without the advice of your doctor who recommended these and made a plan for your pregnancy because self-treatment strategy will lead to no benefits. And both of these drugs are safe to use, so you do not have to worry. Furthermore, for your knowledge, aspirin is usually stopped at 35 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, and Clexane (Enoxaparin sodium) is being continued until delivery, and even after that. So I would again say that please take advice from your particular doctor before stopping any of these medications as your pregnancy is very precious. I hope it has helped you. If you require any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact me."
