<01> description : Is stretching exercise helpful for tight foreskin?

<02> patient : Hello doctor, I am a 22 year old male. IÂ have problem of tight penis skin.Â Whenever I pull my penis skin back during erection it will be very hard to do. Then, my penis skin gets stuck behind the penis forehead and it is very painful to retract back.Â I generally use oil for this problem.Â Please suggest me what to do.

<03> doctor : Hi. For further information consult a urologist online -->
