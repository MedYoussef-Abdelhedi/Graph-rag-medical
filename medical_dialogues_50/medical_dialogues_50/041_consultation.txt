<01> description : What can cause pimples near penis?

<02> patient : Hello doctor, I have pimples near my penis. I do not understand what problem I have.Â I am worried about that. Please explain my problem.

<03> doctor : "Hi. It is very difficult to say what disease you have, because pimple does not come over penile area. It could be molluscum which looks like a pimple. If you can send me the photos, then I can definitely diagnose it. Explain the lesion properly like itching, pain, duration, pus filled, etc? Are you sexually active? Revert back with the photos to a dermatologist online -->"
